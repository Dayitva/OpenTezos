## Connecting to the network
The tezos-client and Tezos RPC needs to be connected to a Tezos node. You can connect to your own tezos node [[2]](/tezos-basics/introduction_to_cli_and_rpc#references) or you can use a community node on the Tezos mainnet or on a Tezos testnet.

[Here](https://tezostaquito.io/docs/rpc_nodes/) you can find a list of community nodes on the mainnet and testnet.

If you use a testnet you can download a free faucet file with test XTZ on it [here](https://faucet.tzalpha.net).


## Tezos RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
RPC [[1]](/tezos-basics/introduction_to_cli_and_rpc#references) is a client-server protocol where the requesting program is the client and the program providing the service is the server. 

Tezos nodes provide a JSON/RPC interface to interact with the Tezos network. Note that although it uses RPC and is JSON based, it does not follow the `JSON-RPC` protocol.

The list of RPC call available is [here](http://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/rpc.html#rpc-index-shell). Please check the protocol version before using these calls. The call available in protocols EDO are available [here](http://tezos.gitlab.io/008/rpc.html#id1).  

### RPC call examples

#### Get block
This call is used to find all the information about a block. The associated metadata may not be present depending on the history mode and block's distance from the head.
```bash
GET NodeUrl/chains/[chain_id]/blocks/[blocks_id]
```

Example to get the block number 1400114 in the main chain using the node giganode.

```bash
GET https://mainnet-tezos.giganode.io/chains/main/blocks/1400114
```

#### Get contract storage
This call is used access to the data of the contract.
```bash
GET NodeUrl/chains/[chain_id]/blocks/[blocks_id]/context/contracts/[contract_id]/storage
```

Example to get the block number 1400114 in the main chain using the node giganode.
```bash
GET https://mainnet-tezos.giganode.io/chains/main/blocks/1400114/context/contracts/KT1Hkg5qeNhfwpKW4fXvq7HGZB9z2EnmCCA9/storage
```

## Tezos-client

Tezos-client is the client when interacting with a Tezos node via RPC. Let's take a look at some examples and how to use it.

### How to install

* On Mac OS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
$ brew install tezos-client
```

* On Ubuntu with binaries:
```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:serokell/tezos && sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y tezos-client
```

* On Fedora with binaries:
```bash
$ dnf copr enable -y @Serokell/Tezos && dnf update -y
$ dnf install -y tezos-client
```

* From sources with OPAM :
    follow this [link](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtoget.html#building-from-sources-via-opam).

### Account activation
Activate your account by replacing `#accountName` and `#faucet` below with an account name and the path to your downloaded faucet file. 

```bash
$ tezos-client activate account #accountName with ~/Downloads/#faucet.json
```

Example :
```bash
$ tezos-client activate account user1 with ~/Downloads/tz1VH3sHQ5SNby95S9EtPQBqZrhgv2DqjPvy.json
```

### Client manual

* For global options
```bash
$ tezos-client --help
```

* For command options
```bash
$ tezos-client [global options] command --help
```

* For version information
```bash
$ tezos-client --version
```

The full documentation on Tezos-admin-client can be found [here](https://tezos.gitlab.io/008/cli-commands.html#cli-commands).

### Client examples
non-exhaustive list of possible commands with tezos-client. To have more command please refer to the [cli manual](https://tezos.gitlab.io/008/cli-commands.html#cli-commands).

#### Get balance
To get the balance of your account you can execute the following command:
```bash
$ tezos-client get balance for #accountName
```

#### Get timestamp
This call is useful to check if the node is synchronized. It returns the UTC time of the latest downloaded block, timezones may differ from your local time.
```bash
$ tezos-client get timestamp
```

#### List known addresses

This call lists implicit accounts registered in your tezos-client.

```bash
$ tezos-client list known addresses
```

#### List known contracts

This call lists all accounts (implicit and smart contract) registered in your tezos-client.
```bash
$ tezos-client list known contracts
```

#### Transfers and receipts
The command line below makes/shows a transaction of 42ꜩ from the account _user1_ to _user2_ (You can also just use the tezos addresses directly).

```bash
$ tezos-client transfer 30 from user1 to user2 --burn-cap 0.5
```

Notice that `--burn-cap` specifies the maximum fee the user is willing to pay for this operation. The actual fee is determined by the system.

You can also add `--dry-run` if you want to just practice and run a transaction simulation.

The recipe of this command line is created :
```
