In this chapter, the reader will learn how to install the official "tezos-client" and "tezos-admin-client" applications and run them with the Command Line Interface. These commands call remote procedures of a Tezos node (local or remote). There are many commands, but we'll see some examples.

## Connecting to the network
The _tezos-client_ and _Tezos RPC_ need a connection to a Tezos node. You can connect to your own [tezos node](/deploy-a-node/introduction), or you can use a *community node*. In both cases, you can set it for the *mainnet* or the *testnet*.

You can find a list of *community nodes* [here](https://tezostaquito.io/docs/rpc_nodes/).

If you use a testnet, you can download a faucet file with free **test**'s XTZ [here](https://faucet.tzalpha.net).

## Tezos RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
RPC[[1]](/tezos-basics/cli-and-rpc#references) is a client-server protocol where the requesting program is the client and the program providing the service is the server.

Tezos nodes provide a JSON/RPC interface to interact with the Tezos network. Although it uses RPC and is JSON-based, it does **not** follow the *JSON-RPC* protocol.

A complete list of calls is available [here](http://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/rpc.html#rpc-index-shell). Make sure to check the protocol version before using these calls. The available calls in the *Edo* protocol (see "[*History of Amendments*](/tezos-basics/history-of-amendments#edo-ptedotezd)" chapter) are [here](http://tezos.gitlab.io/008/rpc.html#id1).

### RPC call examples
#### GET 'block'
This call returns all the information about a block. The associated metadata may not be present depending on the history mode and block's distance from the head.

```bash
GET NodeUrl/chains/[chain_id]/blocks/[blocks_id]
```

Example to get the block number **1400114** from the mainnet using *giganode.io*:

```bash
GET https://mainnet-tezos.giganode.io/chains/main/blocks/1400114
```

#### GET 'contract storage'
This call accesses the storage of a contract.

```bash
GET NodeUrl/chains/[chain_id]/blocks/[blocks_id]/context/contracts/[contract_id]/storage
```

Example to get the storage of contract **KT1Hkg5qeNhfwpKW4fXvq7HGZB9z2EnmCCA9** from block **1400114** on the mainnet using *giganode.io*:

```bash
GET https://mainnet-tezos.giganode.io/chains/main/blocks/1400114/context/contracts/KT1Hkg5qeNhfwpKW4fXvq7HGZB9z2EnmCCA9/storage
```

## Tezos-client (CLI)
_Tezos-client_ is the official client to interact with a Tezos node via RPC. Let's take a look at the installation and some examples.

### How to install
#### On Mac OS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```bash
$ brew install tezos-client
```

#### On Ubuntu with binaries
```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:serokell/tezos && sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y tezos-client
```

#### On Fedora with binaries
```bash
$ dnf copr enable -y @Serokell/Tezos && dnf update -y
$ dnf install -y tezos-client
```

#### From [sources with OPAM](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtoget.html#building-from-sources-via-opam)

### Account activation
Activate your account by replacing "accountName" and "faucet" below with an account name and the path to your downloaded faucet file: 

```bash
$ tezos-client activate account accountName with ~/Downloads/faucet.json
```

Example :
```bash
$ tezos-client activate account user1 with ~/Downloads/tz1VH3sHQ5SNby95S9EtPQBqZrhgv2DqjPvy.json
```

### Tezos Client user manual and version
#### For global options
```bash
$ tezos-client --help
```

#### For command options
```bash
$ tezos-client [global options] command --help
```

#### For version information
```bash
$ tezos-client --version
```

The full commands' list on _Tezos client_ is available [here](https://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/cli-commands.html).

### Tezos Client examples
#### Get balance
To get the balance of the account "accountName":

```bash
$ tezos-client get balance for accountName
```

#### Get timestamp
Call to return the UTC of the latest downloaded block. Timezones may differ from your local time:

```bash
$ tezos-client get timestamp
```

#### List known addresses
This call only lists registered **implicit accounts** in your Tezos client.

```bash
$ tezos-client list known addresses
```

#### List known contracts
This call lists **all registered accounts**, *implicit* **and** *originated* in your Tezos client.

```bash
$ tezos-client list known contracts
```

#### Transfers and receipts
The command below transfers 42ꜩ from the account _user1_ to _user2_ (you can use Tezos addresses directly):

```bash
$ tezos-client transfer 42 from user1 to user2
```

Notice that you can specify the maximum fee for this operation appending "`--fee-cap`" (defaults to 1.0). The network would determine the actual fee lesser than this cap:

```bash
$ tezos-client transfer 42 from user1 to user2 --fee-cap 0.9
```

You can also add "`--dry-run`" or "`-D`" if you want to test and display the transaction without finalizing it.

Below the receipt structure of the call:
```
Current head: BM3smBpBVtHD (timestamp: 2021-03-12T09:42:28.000-00:00, validation: 2021-03-12T09:42:38.372-00:00)

You can observe your actions on explorers like *tzstats*:
* Mainnet: https://tzstats.com
* Edonet: https://edo.tzstats.com
  
OpenTezos has a dedicated module on [how to use an explorer](/explorer/introduction).

## Tezos Admin client
The admin client allows you to interact with the peer-to-peer layer:

- to check the status of the connections
- to force connections to known peers
- to ban/un-ban peers

### How to install
#### On Mac OS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```bash
$ brew install tezos-admin-client
```

#### On Ubuntu with binaries
```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:serokell/tezos && sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y tezos-admin-client
```

#### On Fedora with binaries
```bash
$ dnf copr enable -y @Serokell/Tezos && dnf update -y
$ dnf install -y tezos-admin-client
```

#### From [sources with OPAM](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtoget.html#building-from-sources-via-opam)

### Admin-client user manual and version
#### Global options
```bash
$ tezos-admin-client --help
```

#### Command options
```bash
$ tezos-admin-client [global options] command --help
```

#### Version information
```bash
$ tezos-admin-client --version
```

The full commands' list on Tezos admin-client is available [here](https://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/cli-commands.html).

### Admin-client commands examples
#### Lists remote procedure calls under a given URL prefix
```bash
$ tezos-admin-client rpc list [URL]
```

#### Get the input and the output JSON schemas of an RPC
```bash
$ tezos-admin-client rpc schema [HTTP method] [url]
```

#### RPC with the GET method
```bash
$ tezos-admin-client rpc get [url]
```

#### RPC with the POST method and JSON input data
```bash
$ tezos-admin-client rpc post [url] with [input]
```
Use "file:path" to read from a file:
```bash
$ tezos-admin-client rpc post localhost:4040 with file:/home/methods/params.json
```

#### Listing protocols known by the node
```bash
$ tezos-admin-client list protocols
```

#### Inject a new protocol into the node
"given_dir" is the directory containing the sources of the new protocol.

```bash
$ tezos-admin-client inject protocol [given_dir]
```

#### The last considered heads by the node
```bash
$ tezos-admin-client list heads [-o --output [path]]
```

#### Current config file content
```bash
$ tezos-admin-client config show
```

#### Update the config based on the current CLI values
```bash
$ tezos-admin-client config update
```

#### Usefull command to debug a node that is not syncing
```bash
$ tezos-admin-client tezos-admin-client p2p stat
```

## What have we learned so far?
In this chapter, we saw how to install the CLI. We also introduced you to simple remote procedure calls to a Tezos node.

In the next chapter, we will learn in detail how Tezos allows on-chain decentralized governance without hard forks' troubles.
