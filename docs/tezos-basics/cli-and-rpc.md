## Tezos RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
RPC [[1]](/tezos-basics/introduction_to_cli_and_rpc#referencess) is a client-server protocol where the requesting program is the client and the program providing the service is the server. 

Tezos nodes provide a JSON/RPC interface to interact with the Tezos network. Note that although it is using RPC and it is JSON based, it does not follow the `JSON-RPC` protocol.

## Tezos-client

Tezos-client is the client for interacting with a Tezos node via RPC. Let's take a look at some examples and how to use it.

## How to install

* On Mac OS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) :
```bash
$ brew install tezos-client
```

* On Ubuntu with binaries :
```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:serokell/tezos && sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y tezos-client
```

* On Fedora with binaries :
```bash
$ dnf copr enable -y @Serokell/Tezos && dnf update -y
$ dnf install -y tezos-client
```

* From sources with OPAM :
    follow this [link](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtoget.html#building-from-sources-via-opam).

### Connect to the network
The tezos-client needs to be connected to a Tezos node. You can connect to your own tezos node [[2]](/tezos-basics/introduction_to_cli_and_rpc#references) or you can use a community node on the Tezos mainnet or on a Tezos testnet.
[Here](https://tezostaquito.io/docs/rpc_nodes/) you can find a list of community nodes on the mainnet or testnet.

If you use a testnet you can download a free faucet file with test XTZ on it[here](https://faucet.tzalpha.net).

### Account activation
Activate your account by replacing `#accountName` and `#faucet` below with an account name and the path to your downloaded faucet file. 

//TODO: le bash change la coloration du reste de la ligne 

```bash
$ tezos-client activate account #accountName with ~/Downloads/#faucet.json
```

Example :
```bash
$ tezos-client activate account user1 with ~/Downloads/tz1VH3sHQ5SNby95S9EtPQBqZrhgv2DqjPvy.json
```

### Get balance
To get the balance of your account you can execute the following command:
```
$ tezos-client get balance for #accountName
```

### Get timestamp
This call is useful to check if the node is synchronized. It returns the UTC time of the latest downloaded block so it may differ from your local time.
```
$ tezos-client get timestamp
```

### List known addresses

This call lists implicit accounts registered in your tezos-client.
```
$ tezos-client list known addresses
```

### List known contracts

This call lists all accounts (implicit and smart contract) registered in your tezos-client.
```
$ tezos-client list known contracts
```

### Transfers and receipts
The command line below makes a transaction of 42ꜩ from the account _user1_ to _user2_ (You can also just use the tezos addresses directly).

```
$ tezos-client transfer 30 from user1 to user2 --burn-cap 0.5
```

Notice that `--burn-cap` specifies the maximum fee the user is willing to pay for this operation. The actual fee is determined by the system.

You can also add `--dry-run` if you want to just practice and run a transaction simulation.

The recipe of this command line is created :
```bash
