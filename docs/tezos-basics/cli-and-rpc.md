## Tezos RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
RPC [[1]](/tezos-basics/introduction_to_cli_and_rpc#referencess) is a client-server protocol where the requesting program is the client and the program providing the service is the server. 

Tezos nodes provide a JSON/RPC interface to interact with the Tezos network. Note that although it uses RPC and is JSON based, it does not follow the `JSON-RPC` protocol.

### RPC URLs
//TODO examples of URL (same as CLI)

## tezos-client-admin
The admin client enables you to interact with the peer-to-peer layer in order to:

- check the status of the connections
- force connections to known peers
- ban/unban peers

//TODO: detail one or 2 examples
//TODO : commands admin à beautifuller (et supprimer celles pas necessaires)

## Tezos-client

Tezos-client is the client when interacting with a Tezos node via RPC. Let's take a look at some examples and how to use it.

## How to install

* On Mac OS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) :
```bash
$ brew install tezos-client
```

* On Ubuntu with binaries :
```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:serokell/tezos && sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y tezos-client
```

* On Fedora with binaries :
```bash
$ dnf copr enable -y @Serokell/Tezos && dnf update -y
$ dnf install -y tezos-client
```

* From sources with OPAM :
    follow this [link](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtoget.html#building-from-sources-via-opam).

### Connecting to the network
The tezos-client needs to be connected to a Tezos node. You can connect to your own tezos node [[2]](/tezos-basics/introduction_to_cli_and_rpc#references) or you can use a community node on the Tezos mainnet or on a Tezos testnet.
[Here](https://tezostaquito.io/docs/rpc_nodes/) you can find a list of community nodes on the mainnet and testnet.

If you use a testnet you can download a free faucet file with test XTZ on it[here](https://faucet.tzalpha.net).

### Account activation
Activate your account by replacing `#accountName` and `#faucet` below with an account name and the path to your downloaded faucet file. 

//TODO: le bash change la coloration du reste de la ligne 

```bash
$ tezos-client activate account #accountName with ~/Downloads/#faucet.json
```

Example :
```bash
$ tezos-client activate account user1 with ~/Downloads/tz1VH3sHQ5SNby95S9EtPQBqZrhgv2DqjPvy.json
```

### Node synchronization
//TODO CLI command de synchro
tezos-node bootstrap 

### Get balance
To get the balance of your account you can execute the following command:
```
$ tezos-client get balance for #accountName
```

### Get timestamp
This call is useful to check if the node is synchronized. It returns the UTC time of the latest downloaded block, timezones may differ from your local time.
```
$ tezos-client get timestamp
```

### List known addresses

This call lists implicit accounts registered in your tezos-client.

```
$ tezos-client list known addresses
```

### List known contracts

This call lists all accounts (implicit and smart contract) registered in your tezos-client.
```
$ tezos-client list known contracts
```

### Transfers and receipts
The command line below makes/shows a transaction of 42ꜩ from the account _user1_ to _user2_ (You can also just use the tezos addresses directly).

```
$ tezos-client transfer 30 from user1 to user2 --burn-cap 0.5
```

Notice that `--burn-cap` specifies the maximum fee the user is willing to pay for this operation. The actual fee is determined by the system.

You can also add `--dry-run` if you want to just practice and run a transaction simulation.

The recipe of this command line is created :
```bash
Current head: BM3smBpBVtHD (timestamp: 2021-03-12T09:42:28.000-00:00, validation: 2021-03-12T09:42:38.372-00:00)

```

You can observe your actions on the block explorers :
* Mainnet: https://tzstats.com
* Edonet: https://edo.tzstats.com
* DelphiNet: https://delphi.tzstats.com
  
More info about that in the [How to use an explorer](/explorer) module.
