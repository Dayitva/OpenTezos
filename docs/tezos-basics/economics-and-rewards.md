In this chapter, we will see more detail about the fees of the Tezos network and the baking and endorsing rewards. The calculations you'll learn are helpful for the simplest transaction issuance to the most complex application built on Tezos. You need to understand the basics of fees and gas optimizations. Of course, this will serve you if you are a baker or an endorser.

## Transaction cost
Each transaction on Tezos has a cost. To account for this, the user includes a gas fee when he submits his transaction. Bakers will then choose transactions using a **minimal fee filter**. If the baker chooses a transaction, he will add it to the block and propagate it. The fee is therefore used to pay the bakers. They are calculated using the following formula [[1]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/economics_and_reward#referencess):

Let:
- Minimal Fees: $\text{min}_{F}$
- Size of the operation (in bytes "$\text{B}$"): $\text{s}$  
  (The size "$\text{s}$" is the number of bytes in the complete serialized operation).
- Gas used for the operation (in gas unit "$\text{g}_u$"): $\text{g}$
- Minimal nano-tez per byte: $\text{min(nꜩ/B)}$
- Minimal nano-tez per gas unit: $\text{min(nꜩ/}\text{g}_u\text{)}$  
  Gas unit cost is defined by the protocol. It does not depend on the fee market conditions; it does not depend on arbitrary defaults in config files; etc [[2]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/economics_and_reward#referencess)

Then:
$$
    \text{Fees}\geq\text{min}_{F}+\text{min(nꜩ/B)}\times\text{s}+\text{min(nꜩ/}\text{g}_u\text{)}\times\text{g}
$$

The transaction **default** values are:
- $\text{min}_{F}=\text{100 µꜩ}$
- $\text{min(nꜩ/B)}=\text{250,000 nꜩ/B}\text{ (250 µꜩ/B)}$
- $\text{min(nꜩ/}\text{g}_u)=\text{100 nꜩ/}\text{g}_u$ [[2]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/economics_and_reward#referencess)

In a Tezos transaction, we can add additional information such as smart contracts deployment, smart contract call, etc. This information has a storage cost which is represented in tez per byte. Since the update of the *Delphi* protocol [[3]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/economics_and_reward#referencess) this minimal cost has been reduced from 1ꜩ to 0.25 ꜩ per kilobyte (250 µꜩ/B). The minimal price of creating a new account has thus been lowered from 0.257 tez to 0.06425 tez (the cost of creating an account is important to protect the system from spams and Sybil attacks [[4]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/economics_and_reward#referencess)).

On the Tezos blockchain, gas refers to the cost necessary to perform a transaction on the network. Bakers set the price **_in_** gas based on supply and demand for computational power on the network (needed to process smart contract calls and other transactions).

Gas is used to determine the complexity of the transaction execution and also to avoid infinite loops. It is one of the factors a baker considers before choosing transactions. Before including a transaction, the baker reviews the amount of gas required and its cost per unit. If this ratio is adequate, the baker selects the transaction.

Each *Delphi* transaction has a gas limit: 1,040,000 $\text{g}_u$. If the contract execution, or deployment, exceeds this limit, the contract is considered unusable. This limit is useful to guarantee that the bakers will be able to validate the block in a limited amount of time [[5]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/economics_and_reward#referencess). The gas limit may seem relatively low, but its value is a network inclusion metric: any user should be able to run a node and bake a block within the allotted time. Even *slow* nodes can participate.

The *Delphi* update also increased the *number of computation per unit of gas*. The minimal amount of gas units to achieve operations has been reduced from 10,000 to 1,000. With this update, the execution cost of smart contracts decreased by approximately 75% [[6]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/economics_and_reward#referencess). This evolution allowed more complex smart contracts' executions and was a demonstration of Tezos' adaptability.

Note that a baker also takes into account the gas limit **per block**. In *Delphi*, that limit is 10,400,000 $\text{g}_u$ (10 times the gas limit per operation). So, of course, it limits the number of transactions to include in a block. However, the storage cost isn't a fee that rewards a baker. Actually, this particular fee is "burned", meaning nobody receives it.

## Smart contract execution and optimization
The gas limit is an important parameter for the usability of the smart contract. But there is also a second major limit: each serialized operation has a maximum size of 16,384 bytes. It is impossible to upload a smart contract bigger than this limit.

One must therefore act on these two variables to optimize a contract:

1. The gas consumption  
   Many ways are possible [[7]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/economics_and_reward#referencess). However, note that the majority of the gas is spent on conversions from byte sequences to protocol-specific typed representations (and vice versa). These conversions can be:
   - reading
   - deserialization
   - parsing of bytes
   - checking the correctness of types
   - conversion back to bytes
   
   Follow this [link](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/blob/1f4ad392173a49752f1326a9dd4a4d5b7f6c5e70/docs/gasConsumption.md) for more details on the cost of gas.

2. The contract size  
   The below formula calculates an approximation of a contract's size:

   Let:
   - An assumed constant value per instruction: $\alpha$
   - The number of instructions: $n_i$
   - The sum of the sizes of all variable-size constants (strings, bytes) in the contract: $S$

    Then the contract's size "$C_s$" is:

    $$
      C_s=\alpha\times n_i+S
    $$

    So, the size optimization comes down to decreasing the number of instructions and the variable-size constants. [[7]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/economics_and_reward#referencess)

## Tezos reward
To maintain the network, Tezos needs bakers and endorsers. They stake their tokens and use their computing power to create blocks, manage transactions, vote, and secure the network. In exchange for these tasks, bakers are rewarded with fees.  
Since the Carthage update[[8]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/economics_and_reward#referencess), the reward system has been updated to make the network more robust against non-cooperative baking strategies. 

### Baking reward
When a baker bakes a block, he receives a reward composed of all the transactions' fees contained in the block in addition to a *network reward* computed by the following formula[[9]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/economics_and_reward#referencess):

With:
- "$n_e$": the number of endorsements the block receives  
  **32** endorsements are required to validate a block.

- "$Br_e$": the baking reward per endorsement
- "$Br_b$": the network baking reward per block

Then:

$$
\bm{Br_b=n_e\times Br_e}
$$

For a **high priority** baking:

$$
\bm{Br_e}=\text{1.2500 ꜩ}
$$

For a **low priority** baking:

$$
\bm{Br_e}=\text{0.1875 ꜩ}
$$

This Carthage update allows focusing the baker's efforts on the priority blocks.

If we apply the block reward formula on a **priority block**, we get *40ꜩ*:

$$
\bm{Br_b}=32\times 1.2500=\bm{40}
$$

### Endorser reward
Selected endorsers are also rewarded. One block needs 32 endorsers slots, while one endorser can have more than one. The total reward for an endorser "$Er$" is then easy to calculate.

For:
- "$Er$": the endorser's total reward
- "$n_s$": the endorser's number of slots
- "$Er_b$": the endorsement reward per block

We have:

$$
\bm{Er=n_s\times Er_b}
$$

For a **high priority** block:

$$
\bm{Er_b}=\text{1.250000 ꜩ}
$$

For a **low priority** block:

$$
\bm{Er_b}=\text{0.833333 ꜩ}
$$

### Inflation
Each new block generates 80 new XTZ as a reward. A new block is created each minute. This represents 42 Million XTZ per year (~80 ꜩ $\times$ 60 mins $\times$ 24 hours $\times$ 365 days). At the Tezos launch, the network was composed of 763 Million XTZ.
Therefore the inflation rate of the XTZ token is approximatively 5.5%:
$$
\frac{42,000,000}{763,000,000}=\frac{42}{763}\approx5.5\%
$$

## What have we learned so far?
Thanks to this chapter, you should now have a better understanding of how Tezos economics works. Notably, this understanding can help to build viable Tezos smart contracts.

This chapter is the last one from the *Tezos Basics* module. Next is the examination.
