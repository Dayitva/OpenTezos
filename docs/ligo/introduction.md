Tezos smart contracts are written in [Michelson](https://opentezos.com/michelson), which is a stack-based language.
It forms the lowest level of a Tezos smart contract: the part that will be deployed on a Tezos network.
However, if reading or writing Michelson code is still easy for small smart contracts, 
it can become tedious for more complex smart contracts:
- there are no variables or functions
- no syntactic sugar
- the Michelson code cannot be broken down into several files
- and stack-based languages are not commonly used when it comes to development.

LIGO solves these issues. 
It is a high-level language for smart contracts development.
Smart contracts are developed in Ligo, then compiled into a single Michelson code file. 
This Michelson file becaumes the smart contract that will be deployed on a tezos network.

As said above, LIGO is a programming language for writing **[Tezos](https://tezos.com/) smart contracts**.
This diagram helps to contextualize the role of LIGO in the Tezos ecosystem.

LIGO is active in the left part as a development tool allowing
for the production of smart contracts (scripts in Michelson),
which can be deployed on the blockchain.

LIGO currently offers four flavoured syntaxes:

- **PascaLIGO**, a syntax inspired by Pascal which provides an imperative developer experience.

- **CameLIGO**, an [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) inspired syntax that allows you to write in a functional style.

- **ReasonLIGO**, a [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) inspired syntax that builds on the strong points of OCaml. 
  It aims to be familiar to those coming from JavaScript.
  
- **JsLIGO**, the latest syntax released, inspired by the popular JavaScript language.


> **Imperative programming** is a programming paradigm that describes 
> the operations in sequences of instructions executed by the computer to change the state of the program.

> **Functional programming** is a declarative programming paradigm that considers computation as an evaluation of mathematical functions.

Here is an example of a Counter contract that handles a single integer's "counter" value 
as storage and allows users to increment, decrement or reset this counter.

PascaLigo will be used throughout this module.
The main difference between the syntaxes is that PascaLigo is a more imperative syntax while ReasonLigo 
and CameLigo are functional. 
Moreover there are "for" and "while" loops in PascaLigo which are not found in the other ones.

The goal of this module is to allow a developer to install the LIGO compiler on his operating system
by providing the essential skills to write and deploy his first smart contract
onto the Tezos blockchain.

It will include the basics of the LIGO language,
inspired by the [official documentation](https://ligolang.org/docs/language-basics/types),
as well as detailed smart contract examples and an exam to check your understanding.
