`Tokens` are the basis of _Decentralized Finance_, just like _Fiat currencies_ (e.g. USD, EUR) are the basis of traditional finance. They represents a way to exchange value. However contrary to traditional finance, tokens can represent much more than a simple currency. Tokens can represent any type of virtual or physical asset or value. For instance, real-estate which has so far always been a illiquid market can now be tokenized and traded on exchanges. Tokens can also enclose collectibles or luxury items such as art. They can enclose traditional finance products like equity, stocks, bonds, etc. In this chapter, we will see the implementation of tokens in Tezos and how they are the future of finance.

## Fungible Tokens Vs. Non-Fungible Tokens
Today, [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/) on Ethereum is the most popular token standard. ERC-20 is an interface to build _Fungible Tokens_, i.e. a class of identical tokens. For instance, two XTZ tokens are identical. Two cans of the same soda brand are identical. They are fungible: one is exactly the same as the other.

However, a concert ticket at the front row is obviously not equivalent to a concert ticket at the last row. Theses tickets are part of the same class (i.e. concert tickets) but they are not interchangeable: they are non-fungible. 

Two pieces of art are also non-fungible. The ownership of these assets can be enclosed in a _Non-Fungible Token_ (or _NFT_ for short) and bought, sold, exchanged, etc like any other token. NFTs are particularly interesting for collectibles as their scarcity can be provably demonstrated on the blockchain (i.e. An owner can prove that he has the only copy that exists in the world.)

NFTs have additionally been used to represent the right to own, use, and exchange digital collectibles, multimedia, in-game assets, permissions, insurance, and much more [[1]](/defi/token-standards#references). [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/) on Ethereum is the most popular NFT token standard.

## Tokens on Tezos
Within Tezos, the latest token standard is [FA2](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/-/blob/master/proposals/tzip-12/tzip-12.md) (standing for _Financial Application 2_) and it supports a wide range of token types: fungible, non-fungible, non-transferable, as well as multi-asset contracts. This standard is the successor to [FA1.2](https://assets.tqtezos.com/docs/token-contracts/fa12/1-fa12-intro/) that only supports fungible tokens but is still widely used in the Tezos ecosystem.

Many considerations weigh on the implementer of a token contract. Tokens might be fungible or non-fungible. A variety of transfer permission policies can be used to define how many tokens can be transferred, who can perform a transfer, and who can receive tokens. A token contract can be designed to support a single token type (e.g. ERC-20 or ERC-721) or multiple token types (e.g. ERC-1155) to optimize batch transfers and atomic swaps of the tokens.

The FA2 standard aims to provide significant expressivity to contract developers to create new types of tokens while maintaining a common interface standard for wallet integrators and external developers.

A particular FA2 implementation may support either a single token type per contract or multiple tokens per contract, including hybrid implementations where multiple token kinds (fungible, non-fungible, non-transferable etc) can coexist (e.g. in a fractionalized NFT contract) [[2]](/defi/token-standards#references).
