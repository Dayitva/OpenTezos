## What is _DeFi_ ?
_DeFi_ is an acronym of **De**centralized and **Fi**nance :

* The word _Finance_ refers to all traditional financial tools and services that have been existing since the dawn of time, such as buying, selling currencies, transferring, borrowing, lending money, trading, betting, insuring, etc. Nothing new there.

* The word _Decentralized_ refers to the blockchain and how each protocol is running on a multitude of servers (or nodes) all over there world guaranteeing peer-to-peer, quick, synchronized, uncensorable, immutable and non-retractable transactions. Moreover these transactions are visible, transparent and auditable by anyone. 

These two are mixed together allows to re-create financial services previously only available through banks, centralized exchanges, insurance companies, etc...
Although it started as a decentralized reproduction of existing centralized financial models (i.e. smart contracts reproducing the order book model), it soon started to create new opportunities which are only available through the decentralized nature of the blockchain (i.e. smart contracts creating _Automated Maket Maker_) and thus impossible to reproduce in traditional finance.

The objective of DeFi is to create added financial value accessible to everyone, decentralized, instantaneous, transparent and cutting out middlemen, in order to execute transactions, create and manage savings, trade, and obtain returns on financial assets not regulated by a central power.

DeFi tools and services are often compared to `Money LEGOs` [[1]](/defi/introduction#references). Instead of creating an isolated software from the ground up like banks do, DeFi tools and services usually take advantage of the whole ecosystem in place, and integrate within them just like _LEGO_ blocks would with each other. For instance, decentralized exchanges (_DEXs_ for short) rely on tokens, stable coins and oracles, which themselves rely on the smart contracts and the blockchain consensus. Additionally, we can find DeFi apps on top of DEXs e.g. for swapping, yield farming, lending, insurances, etc..
Just like _LEGO_ blocks, DeFi applications can layer on top of each other and build the foundation needed to create a completely decentralized financial layer — cutting out the middle man (banks, insurance companies, etc.) to reduce the costs and make the service more inclusive.

## DeFi on Tezos

In this module we are going to learn more about the main areas where DeFi has been revolutionising finance [[2]](/defi/introduction#references) and what solutions have been or are currently being developed on Tezos, mainly:

[Token Standards](/defi/token-standards): Token standards refer to the subsidiary of smart contract standards. Today, `ERC-20` is one of the most popular token standards based on the Ethereum network. Within Tezos, the latest token standard is `FA2` and this standard supports a wide range of token types: fungible, non-fungible, non-transferable, as well as multi-asset contracts. 

[Decentralized Exchanges](/defi/dexs): This type of exchange refers to one which enables the trading of various digital assets in a peer-to-peer form. This form dissuades the need for an intermediary or centralized, single party. Today, you can trade tez and related FA2 supported assets on [Dexter](https://dexter.exchange/) and [Quipuswap](https://quipuswap.com/). 

[Wrapped Assets](/defi/wrapped-assets): A wrapped asset is one which bridges another asset from a different native public blockchain network to the one in which it is wrapping itself to. Wrapped assets not only improve the functionality and usability of the asset in which it is wrapped to, but also opens up a wide array of higher-level financial services that wouldn't be available previously. On Tezos, we’ve seen the addition of Wrapped ETH ([ETHtz](https://ethtz.io/)), Wrapped Tezos ([wXTZ](https://medium.com/stakerdao/the-wrapped-tezos-wxtz-beta-guide-6917fa70116e)), and the addition of over 20 ERC-20 assets from Bender Labs coming in the near future. 

[Cross-Chain Swaps](/defi/cross-chain-swaps): A cross-chain swap (Atomic Swap) refers to the action of exchanging two different cryptocurrencies through a peer-to-peer form. This process enable two parties to exchange between each other trustless and w/o third-party moderation. Today, [TEZEX](https://tezex.io/) is currently in development and will enable cross-chain swaps.

[On-Chain Price Oracles](/defi/oracles): Oracles refer to the off-chain data sources that provide an answer to specific questions/information that cannot be directly obtained on-chain. Through the usage of oracles, information such as price and more can be obtained and trusted - through the amalgamation of multiple price feeds (oracles). On Tezos, Harbinger oracles provide this service as well as Kaiko. A Chainlink integration is expected in the near future by the SmartPy team. 

[Stablecoins](/defi/stablecoins): Stablecoins refers to assets that are backed typically by a reserve asset and offer price stability against an underwise volatile native asset. These are usually aligned to fiat currencies such as the US Dollars in order to provide a _safe haven_ against the volatility of markets. Today, Tezos offers the [Kolibri](https://kolibri.finance/) stablecoin (currently only on the testnet) and the [Stably USDS](https://www.stably.io/) which is available on the mainnet and is fully backed by fiat reserves and regulated by Prime Trust, a Nevada-chartered trust company that also acts as the regulated administrator of USDS. 

[Synthetics](/defi/synthetics): Synthetic assets are those in which provide opportunity for a various array of assets that are not native to the underlying asset, nor require one to hold the underlying asset. A synthetic exchange project on Tezos is expected to launch on Tezos this year.

[Lending and flash loans](/defi/lending): Crypto assets sitting in a wallet don’t accrue interest. The underlying value may increase or decrease, but it is not earning anything for holding that particular cryptocurrency. This is where DeFi loans come in. DeFi allows to lend crypto to someone else and earn interest on the loan. Projects on lending on Tezos are currently in development.
