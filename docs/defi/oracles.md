Oracles refer to the off-chain data sources that provide an answer to specific questions/information that cannot be directly obtained on-chain. Through the usage of oracles, information such as price and more can be obtained and trusted - through the amalgamation of multiple price feeds (oracles).

## Oracles on Tezos
On Tezos, [Harbinger oracles](https://medium.com/@Blockscale/introducing-harbinger-a-self-sustaining-price-oracle-for-tezos-7cab5c9971d) provide this service as well as Kaiko. A [Chainlink integration](https://www.coindesk.com/tezos-blockchain-chainlink-oracle-services) is expected in the near future by the SmartPy team.
