Synthetics are contracts between two parties that both bet on the opposite outcome of the value of an asset and then split the difference in profit/loss. The actual asset is not purchased in this contract. Both parties simply bet on the value appreciating or depreciating.

Example: Alice and Bob both send $100 in value to a contract, making the total value of the contract $200. Alice and Bob decide that the contract represents a BTC/USD value. Alice bets that the BTC price will go up and Bob bets that the BTC price will go down. They agree on an expiry date for this bet. Since this is a synthetic contract, no actual BTC is bought. All they do is take the current USD price of BTC as a starting point, place their bets and wait until expiry date.

//TODO: explain why Alice doesn't simply get $120

If the value of BTC goes up 20% in the set period of the bet, Alice's $100 should now be worth $120. As agreed on, the difference is split between Alice and Bob. Alice gets $100 + ($20/2) = $110 and Bob gets $100 - ($20/2) = $90.

Simple as that. **This is how you speculate on the price of BTC without buying any BTC.**

Conversely, if the value of BTC goes down 20% in the set period of the bet, Alice's $100 should now be worth $80. As agreed on, the difference is split between Alice and Bob. Alice gets $100 - ($20/2) = $90 and Bob gets $100 + ($20/2) = $110.

As you don't have to actually purchase the asset, Synthetics are particularly interesting for assets that have very low liquidity, are hard to transact, or are simply not available to trade.

## Synthetics & Blockchain
Synthetics have existed way before their use in blockchain, but it is unlikely you have heard of them before. Why? Because without blockchain, synthetics are "paper bets" only enforceable by legal contracts that are difficult and expensive to set up. That's why only banks and big investment firms were able to use synthetics. Now that the outcomes of the bets are set and enforced automatically through smart contracts, anyone can easily get access to synthetic investments.

//TODO: it doesn't seem easy for Alice to find Bob. Is there some kind of market?

## Synthetics Vs Wrapped Asset
_Synthetics_ are not to be confused with _Wrapped Assets_. As seen in the [previous chapter](/defi/wrapped-assets), a wrapped asset represents the actual asset and can be exchanged 1:1 against that asset. A synthetic represents your share of a bet against the other players. As such, anything can be bet upon as long as you have an oracle that updates its price in the synthetic smart contract. We could imagine synthetics been used on stocks like Apple, Tesla, etc.

## Synthetics on Tezos
[_SEXP_](https://www.publish0x.com/publish0x-posts/sexp-a-tezos-based-synthetic-exchange-xmkjjzq) is a synthetics exchange on Tezos currently in development. _SEXP_ will make use of Harbinger oracles, and use Tezos staking rewards to provide a fully free service. [Michelson](/michelson) is used for the smart contracts, the token standard will be [FA2](/defi/token-standards), and the web app is going to work with all wallets that support [Beacon](https://www.walletbeacon.io/).
