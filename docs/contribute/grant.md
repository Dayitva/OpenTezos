The goal of the _Tezos Foundation_ is to develop the Tezos ecosystem, which includes offering [grant programs](https://grants.tezos.foundation/). In this chapter, we’ll take a closer look at how it works.

In order to receive a _Tezos Foundation_ grant one has to devise a project idea, apply for a grant, wait for the application to be reviewed, and react to the review’s findings. Let’s look at each of those phases in greater detail.

## Devise a project
Anyone can apply for a _Tezos Foundation_ grant if they have an idea that would boost the development of Tezos. The foundation accepts applications in the following areas:

- *Baking*: Tezos has a growing number of bakers in its ecosystem that help secure the network by signing and publishing blocks. The foundation's goal is to empower bakers by supporting the development of standardized tools, tutorials and cloud applications.
  
- *Developer Experience*: The foundation's goal is to make Tezos easy to build on and onboard new developers to the ecosystem. The foundation is looking to support tools, tutorials and documentation to improve user experience for all Tezos developers.
  
- *Education and Training*: The growth and success of Tezos is heavily linked to the Tezos community. To grow and support the community, the foundation want to enable all ecosystem members around the world.

- *End-User Applications*: Tezos enables new types of applications, which can address problems that have been traditionally difficult to solve using legacy software stacks. The foundation is looking to support new applications that drive wide adoption and benefit standardization, censorship-resistance, or user control on the Tezos protocol.

- *Privacy*: Censorship-resistance is key for all developments on Tezos. The foundation's goal is to support research and development of infrastructure to build on Tezos’ strengths and enhance privacy-preserving solutions.

- *Security*: Tezos has the assurance required for high value use cases and a focus on formal methods. Given this strength the foundation aims to support projects building security solutions for Tezos.

- *Other*: Projects targeting categories not listed here that may advance the Tezos ecosystem!

## Apply for a grant
First, you have to register at the [Tezos Foundation’s platform for grants](https://grants.tezos.foundation/). Then you choose the area that corresponds to your project and make an offer by clicking the respective button. Now you can fill in your application.

The application form includes the following:

- Your personal information

- Info on your entity in case you represent one

- Description of your team and your offer

- List of your project’s deliverables
  
- An attachment with an expanded description of your offer, its technical details, team info, roadmap, and budget breakdown
  
After that, the system will offer you to provide feedback on the application process. If you think you know how to make it better, that’s the right moment to share your thoughts. The feedback is not mandatory, though, and you can freely just apply without any further comment.

As long as the button is not pushed, you can edit your application by returning to any of the five steps above. Once the button is pushed, no changes are possible.

## Wait for the application to be reviewed
On average, the review process takes eight to twelve weeks.

First, applications are checked for their accordance with formal and conceptual requirements applicable at the Tezos Foundation. Several Tezos ecosystem contributors under the auspices of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC, see its current line-up here) perform the actual check. At this phase, the TAC’s main goal is to ensure reasonable management of any potential conflicting interests.

The passing applications then go to the TAC for technical analysis and evaluation. The TAC itself does not make decisions on grants but merely assesses the technological merits of applications as well as their usefulness for the entire ecosystem.

If the TAC liked your application, you will have to undergo due diligence for the Executive Committee or the Tezos Foundation Council to make the final decision. There are three options: accept, reject, or ask the grant-seeker to revise it.

You can always see your application’s current status in your account at the Tezos Foundation’s platform for grants.

## React to the review’s findings
If your application was rejected, don’t you fret! Better find out the exact reason for rejection, rectify whatever has been wrong with your project, and try again. If they offered you to revise your application, just do it!

If your application passed, the Tezos Foundation will contact you to help with the grant’s paperwork. Once it is over, you will get the funding you asked for, but not the entire amount at once. Instead, the funding will be stage-wise as you perform the work pointed out in your roadmap.

## Conclusion
According to the Tezos Foundation’s biannual report, there were 56 projects that had received grants in different areas from February to September 2020 with 41% of the project founders receiving any sort of grant for the first time ever. The Tezos ecosystem as a whole and the Tezos Foundation as its integral part always welcome new teams and new ideas.
