Tezos is user-centric blockchain. As seen in the [governance chapter](/tezos-basics/governance-on-chain), the evolution of Tezos is decided by its stakeholders. Anyone can contribute, from reporting a simple issue to coding and developing a whole new platform based on Tezos, there are many opportunities that will benefit you and the ecosystem. In this module we will see how to:
