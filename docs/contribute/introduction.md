Tezos is user-centric blockchain. As seen in the [governance chapter](/tezos-basics/governance-on-chain), the evolution of Tezos is decided by its stakeholders. Anyone can contribute, from reporting a simple issue to coding and developing a whole new platform based on Tezos, there are many opportunities that will benefit you and the ecosystem. In this module we will see how to:

- [report an issue](/contribute/report-issue)

- [modify or add new content to OpenTezos](/contribute/opentezos)

- [contribute to the Tezos Core Protocol](/contribute/tezos-core)

- [apply for a grant](/contribute/grant)

- [become a baker](/contribute/baker)
