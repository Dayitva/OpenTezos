The great website you are currently browsing is called _OpenTezos_ and will later be merged with the upcoming wiki.tezos.com. It is therefore important that all the content here is up to date and error-free. If you see an error, you can either [submit an issue](/contribute/report-issue) or go a step further by actually correcting the error yourself and submitting it for review. Here is how to proceed:

- On the page that you see the error on, scroll all the way down and click the link `Edit this page`.

- You are redirected the file on github corresponding to this chapter. Click on the pen logo on the upper right corner saying `Fork this project and edit the file`.

- The chapter file is now opening in your browser. Proceed to edit its content to correct the error, then scroll down to the `Propose changes` section. Enter a title and a description to your correction proposal then click `Propose changes`.
