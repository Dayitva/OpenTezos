title: CLI to become a baker

In this chapter we will see the CLI command lines for registering as a delegate and then we will see how to exercise your rights as a baker, endorser and accuser.

To learn more about how baking works, take a look at the [Baking](/baking) module.

This module requires the deployment of its own Tezos node explained in the module [Deploy a node](/deploy-a-node).

## Running a Delegate

A delegate is responsible for baking blocks, endorsing blocks and accusing other delegates in case they try to double bake or double endorse.

### What you need

- Reliable internet connection
- At least 8,000 XTZ (1 roll) in your wallet
- A tezos node configured and running (if not go [here](/deploy-a-node))

### Registration

#### Create an implicit account

//TODO

#### Supply the implicit account

//TODO

#### Register as a delagate

To run a delegate, you first need to register as one using your implicit account:

```shell
tezos-client register key bob as delegate
```

Once registered, you need to wait 7 cycles (~ 20 days) for your rights to be considered.

### Baker

The baker is a daemon that, once connected to an account, computes the baking rights for that account, collects transactions from the mempool and bakes a block. Note that the baker is the only program that needs direct access to the node data directory for performance reasons.

Letâ€™s launch the daemon pointing to the standard node directory and baking for user *bob*

```shell
tezos-baker-alpha run with local node ~/.tezos-node bob
```

> Warning ! Remember that having two bakers or endorsers running connected to the same account could lead to double baking/endorsing and the loss of all your bonds. If you are worried about the availability of your node when it is its turn to bake/endorse, there are other ways than duplicating your credentials (see the discussion in section [Inactive delegates](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtorun.html#inactive-delegates)). Never use the same account on two daemons.

### Endorser

The endorser is a daemon that, once connected to an account, computes the endorsing rights for that account and, upon reception of a new block, verifies the validity of the block and emits an endorsement operation. It can endorse for a specific account or if omitted it endorses for all accounts.

```shell
tezos-endorser-alpha run
```

### Accuser

The accuser is a daemon that monitors all blocks received on all chains and looks for:
- bakers who signed two blocks at the same level
- endorsers who injected more than one endorsement operation for the same baking slot

Upon finding such irregularity, it will emit respectively a double-baking or double-endorsing denunciation operation, which will cause the offender to lose its security deposit.

```shell
tezos-accuser-alpha run
```
