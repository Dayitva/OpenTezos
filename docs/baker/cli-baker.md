title: CLI to become a baker

In this chapter we will see the CLI command lines for registering as a delegate and then we will see how to exercise your rights as a baker, endorser and accuser.

To learn more about how baking works take a look at the [Baking](/baking) module.

This module requires the deployment of its own Tezos node explained in the module [Deploy a node](/deploy-a-node).

## Running a Delegate

A delegate is responsible for baking blocks, endorsing blocks and accusing other delegates in case they try to double bake or double endorse.

### What you need

- Reliable internet connection
- At least 8,000 XTZ (1 roll) in your wallet
- A tezos node configured and running (if not go [here](/deploy-a-node))


### Register as a delagate

To run a delegate, you first need to register as one using your implicit account:

```shell
tezos-client register key bob as delegate
```

Once registered, you need to wait 7 cycles (~ 20 days) for your rights to be considered.

### Baker

The baker is a daemon that, once connected to an account, computes the baking rights for that account, collects transactions from the mempool and bakes a block. Note that the baker is the only program that needs direct access to the node data directory for performance reasons.

Letâ€™s launch the daemon pointing to the standard node directory and baking for user _bob_

```shell
tezos-baker-alpha run with local node ~/.tezos-node bob
```
