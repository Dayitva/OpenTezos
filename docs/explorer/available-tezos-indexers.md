## Indexers potential features

- **Speed**
- **Full-text search**
- **The mempool** is made of all transactions which have been submitted for inclusion in the chain but not included in a block yet by bakers.
- **Bigmap support** Allows you to access and observe the content of a Big Map from a smart contract.
- **API Server**
  - **Explorer API** for accessing individual objects of the explorer.
  - **Time-series API** only contain numeric data types and are indexed by one date field. Through API calls, users can retrieve the entire time-series as well as a slice of it. It is great for aggregate counters and statistics over specific fields.
  - **Tables API** can include various unsorted data types (strings, numbers, dates, etc.) and can be filtered by different fields.
