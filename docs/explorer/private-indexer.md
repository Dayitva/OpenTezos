import NotificationBar from '../../src/components/docs/NotificationBar';

The tools presented in this module so far, are fully public, meaning that everyone can use them. However, they are meant for public networks, and who the user is, is dependent on the infrastructure and configuration of these services. Some organizations are more interested in deploying their own private Tezos network, either for private testing before going public, or for entirely private use. Refer to the [Private blockchain module](/private) for more info. Therefore, it is possible to use an indexer on private networks.

Fortunately, all public developments on Tezos are open-source and can easily be adapted for a private network, i.e. an indexer can be deployed and configured to watch a private network.

In this chapter, we will see how the source code of _TzIndex_ and _TzStats_ can be used to make a private indexer, either for use on a private network or a public network.

This chapter is divided into three parts:
- how to quickly set up a private network.
- how to install and configure these tools
- how to use them

# Prerequisites
To index a private network, a few things are required:
- a private Tezos network
- a few funded accounts
- a smart contract
- some operations

Let's start by setting up a private network. The process is quite difficult as it requires starting and configuring Tezos nodes (please refer to the [Private Blockchain module](/private) for more info). Instead, let's choose an easier way by only simulating a private network using _Ganache_, a node module used for tests and simulations of Tezos and Ethereum blockchains. _Ganache_ provides also 10 funded accounts to start.

//TODO: I changed the paragraph abov to refer to the future Private Blockchain module, and only mention Ganache as a `simulation` of a private network and not a real private network. Please look into it and make sure this is true or not.

Let's use the _Raffle_ smart contract from the [LIGO module](/ligo/contracts-ligo) and migrate it onto our private network using the _Truffle_ configuration from the [Build a Dapp module](/dapp).

## Installing the prerequisites
The complete source code of the raffle contract can be found [here](https://github.com/bepi-octo/raffle-smart-contract.git).

It contains a ganache configuration (with predefined accounts), three smart contracts and their associated migrations:
1. a dummy smart contract, with a big map as storage
2. a raffle smart contract, using a big map
3. a raffle smart contract, using a map

//TODO: In tzstats-smart-contracts line 13, you are only mentioning 2 smart contracts and here 3, why?

//TODO: Move the raffle-smart-contract repo into opentezos/examples/ligo/raffle

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/bepi-octo/raffle-smart-contract.git
$ cd 
$ npm install -g truffle@tezos
$ npm install 
```

_TzIndex_ is written in _Go_, a statically typed compiled programming language developed by _Google_. Install it using the instructions at [golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Next action is to install the docker images of _TzIndex_. Install _Docker_ using the instructions at [docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Launching Ganache
In `package.json`, one script is defined:
```json
  "scripts": {
    "start-sandbox": "ganache-cli --flavor tezos --seed alice"
  }
```

<NotificationBar>
  <p>There are several versions of `ganache-cli`. Only the version suffixed by `-tezos` supports the Tezos blockchain. The specific version used in the project can be found in the `devDependencies` section in `package.json`.
  </p>
</NotificationBar>

//TODO: You speak about `-tezos` but I don't see it anywhere.

This script starts a simulated private Tezos blockchain with _ganache_:

//TODO: simulated or not?

```shell
$ npm run start-sandox
Ganache CLI v6.12.1-tezos.0 (ganache-core: 2.13.2-tezos.2)

Notice all the funded accounts created by _Ganache_.

## Migrating the _Raffle_ contracts
The contracts can be migrated onto the private network. More details can be found about the _Truffle_ tool in the [Build a Dapp module](/dapp).

First, the private network has to be defined in the _truffle-config.js_ file. A `development` subsection should be found under the `networks` section:

```json
    development: {
      host: "http://localhost",
      port: 8732,
      network_id: "*",
      secretKey: alice.sk,
      type: "tezos"
    }
```

//TODO: Add some small explations about this code above

We're going to used the accounts from the `scripts/sandbox/account.js` file.
The contracts can now be migrated as follows:

```shell
$ truffle migrate --network development
```

Three contracts are deployed onto our private network:
1. the first contract holds a big map, and does not do anything.
This dummy contract is used to bypass a _TzStats_ bug regarding big maps: 
the first big map (whose index is 0) is not fetched by the frontend.
2. a raffle contract using map
3. a raffle using big map
//TODO: Repetition with line 36

The migration files also include some operations to open a raffle and buy a ticket automatically once the contracts are deployed.

<NotificationBar>
  <p>The same smart contract is deployed twice: one with _maps_ and the other with _big maps_. Later on, these two smart contracts will be used to highlight the difference between the processing of _maps_ and _big maps_ by _TzStats_.
  </p>
</NotificationBar>

# Setting up a private indexer (_TzIndex_)
_TzIndex_ is an open-source indexer: it can freely be used and modified. The source code is available at [github.com/blockwatch-cc/tzindex](https://github.com/blockwatch-cc/tzindex)

To start the application, proceed as follows:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/blockwatch-cc/tzindex
$ cd tzindex
$ make build
$ ls tzindex
tzindex

```
//TODO: Is the last 'tzindex' above correct? Isn't it missing a $ or some ./ ?

A _TzIndex_ binary is created in the same directory. The indexer can now watch the private network with this command:

```shell
$ ./tzindex run --rpcurl 127.0.0.1:8732 --notls --enable-cors
```

Note the following options:
- _--rpcurl_: url of the ganache private network rpc node
- _--notls_: option to use _http_ instead of _https_
- _--enable-cors_: used for the frontend (_TzStats_)
//TODO: "used for the frontend" is not a sufficient explanation...

_TzIndex_ now exposes its API on http://localhost:8000. 

A `db/` folder is created when launching _TzIndex_ for the first time: it contains all the data indexed about the private network. 

<NotificationBar>
  <p>When restarting ganache, a blank new network is created. The `db/` folder, containing the old data has to be removed in order to make _TzIndex_ index the new network.
  </p>
</NotificationBar>

# Setting up a private explorer (_TzStats_)
_TzStats_ is the open-source frontend made to display the data from _TzIndex_.
The source code is available at [github.com/blockwatch-cc/tzstats](https://github.com/blockwatch-cc/tzstats)

_TzStats_ can interact with _TzIndex_ by setting the *TZSTATS_API_URL* variable to the url of the _TzIndex_ API.

The application can be launched with:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/blockwatch-cc/tzstats
$ cd tzstats
$ echo 'TZSTATS_API_URL=http://localhost:8000' > development.env
$ npm install
$ yarn start
```

<NotificationBar>
  <p>An error might occur during the npm install. 
  //TODO: What error exactly? (User may get different errors)
  If so, modify the `sass` field under `scripts` in the `package.json` file as follows:
  ```json
  "sass": "npx sass src/styles/scss/index.scss:src/styles/css/index.css"
  ```
  Then run `npm install` again.
  </p>
</NotificationBar>

_TzStats_ will now launch in your web browser.

# Interacting with the private explorer
At this point, the working context is:
- a simulated private network running through Ganache
- three migrated contracts
- two contract calls 
- _TzIndex_ indexing the private network
- _TzStats_ connected to _TzIndex_, and running

This means that there has already been some activity that we can watch on our network. 

## Watching activity on _TzStats_
_TzStats_ is running at http://localhost:3000: 

![](../../static/img/explorer/tzstat-1.png "Welcome page of a private tzstats")

Notice that the frontend is different from its public version on [TzStats.com](https://tzstats.com/) but the inner workings are the same.

On top, the search bar allows you to search for transactions, blocks, addresses, etc. The left panel contains various information displayed such as the number of baked blocks.

Click on it to get more info on that block:
![](../../static/img/explorer/tzstat-2.png "Block details page")

Many block details are displayed, most of them can be clicked on for even more info. The block above only contains one operation, which is a cl to our smart contracts. Click the hash to open the operation page:

![](../../static/img/explorer/tzstat-3.png "Smart contract call details page")

The sender does match Alice's _pkh_ from _scripts/sandbox/account.js_.
//TODO: You haven't defined what a pkh is in this module so far
Notice the contract address matches the returned address from the migration output logs.

Click on the address to inspect the smart contract:
![](../../static/img/explorer/tzstat-4.png "Smart contract details page")

You can see the history of calls, the entrypoints, the storage, etc. Notice the two calls made by _Truffle_: the origination of the contract, and the purchase of a ticket.

The storage page displays the storage definition, the type of each field and their associated current value. Note that one participant is registered in the raffle and the contract holds one XTZ (from selling one ticket).
![](../../static/img/explorer/tzstat-5.png "Smart contract storage page")

### About big maps
Note that the *sold_tickets* _big map_ should hold an `address` as value, but it displays `1` in the storage. Indeed, since _big maps_ are meant to hold unbounded lists of data, they cannot be loaded directly into the storage (out of performance concerns). Each _big map_ is indexed and the number `1` being displayed is the index number of the _big map_. Its data can actually be accessed by clicking on the `Bigmap 1` section.

![](../../static/img/explorer/tzstat-6.png "Big map section")

Regular _maps_ are meant to be used with limited data size as the data is directly retrieved from the storage section. You can see an example of such a _map_ in the second migrated smart contract (baked in the fourth block):

![](../../static/img/explorer/tzstat-7.png "Storage page")

The _TzStats_ interface is very user-friendly and every piece of information can easily be read by clicking on each element. Remember that all this information is coming from the data retrieved by the indexer: _TzStats_ just displays them.

## Watching activity from _TzIndex_
The same pieces of information can be retrieved without the frontend by just using the _TzIndex_ API. For each page opened on _TzStats_, an API call is made to _TzIndex_. Each API call can be seen in the network explorer by pressing F12 in the network section.

![](../../static/img/explorer/tzstat-8.png "Retrieving the API call")

The _request URL_ shows the called API endpoints:

```shell
$ GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/explorer/contract/KT1HJ8VJ9rHkoi4FfzHPburSe1VdYn8AU4AF?

A lot of information is displayed, such as the address of the contract, but some data is also missing like the storage. Another API call has to be made for that:

```shell
$ GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/explorer/contract/KT1HJ8VJ9rHkoi4FfzHPburSe1VdYn8AU4AF/storage?

  }
}

```

# Setting up a private indexer for a public network
Public networks can also be monitored with a local indexer. It just has to monitor a node: either a local node, or a public node (listed at [tezostaquito.io/docs/rpc_nodes](https://tezostaquito.io/docs/rpc_nodes/)).

//TODO: use cases? Why would someone use a private indexer on a public network?

```shell
$ ./tzindex run --rpcurl <node_url> --notls --enable-cors
```

There are three operation modes, which retrieve more or less data:
- _Full regular_: all indexes are built (default mode)
- _Light light-weight_: consensus and governance indexes are not built (use _--light_ in the CLI)
- _Validate_: state validation mode for checking accounts and balances at each block/cycle (use _--validate_ in the CLI)

Note that whichever mode your choose, indexing a public network will take a long time due to the amount of data to be fetched.

## Conclusion
Running a private network does not condemn its user to be blind to whatever is happening on their network: private indexers and explorers can be set up to index and monitor a private network.

These private tools can also be used to monitor public networks, even if public tools are already set up for that purpose.

Finally, indexers can come in handy as additional tools to libraries (such as [Taquito](https://tezostaquito.io/)) or wallets. Indeed, _big maps_ are not easily handled with these tools. For instance, it is not possible to retrieve all the keys of a _big map_. However, indexers solve this issue with a simple REST call. You can learn more in the [Build a Dapp module](/dapp)).
