This chapter aims at preparing your working environment to be ready to code, 
test and compile your smart contracts.

You can code locally on your favorite ide and/or use the [online editor](https://smartpy.io/ide) 
which is designed with interesting features to facilitate the developer's work.

## Online Editor

The SmartPy online editor isnâ€™t just a simple text editor for smart contracts.
It comes with a built-in simulation suite that provides powerful testing tools for developers.

To familiarize yourself with SmartPy you can choose among the numerous existing examples
of smart contracts, by going to the **Templates** tab.

On the left screen of the online Editor you can:
- Write your code on the left screen
- Run and test your code

Once your run your code you can visualize the result on the right screen, which contains:
- Your python code
- Your generated michelson contract and storage code as well as the one in json format
- A summary of your test scenario and the generated michelson parameter code
- You can deploy your michelson contract

## Write, test and compile from your IDE

In the next chapter we will use the online editor so only the basic commands for using SmartPy on a local IDE are provided.

### Prerequisite

- Python 3
- Text editor

### Creation of a virtual environment
A virtual environment is a self-contained python installation, separated from the global Python installation.
It contains its own modules. Hence, it is most useful when a specific module version is needed, without affecting the other modules.
Run this command to create a virtual environment:

```shell
$ python3 -m venv /path/to/env
```

### Activating the environment
By default, your OS uses the python interpreter from /usr/bin/python. 
Once that a virtual environment is created, it has to be activated in order to be used by the OS.

You can activate your virtual environment by running:
```shell
$ source /path/to/env/bin/activate
```
The name of the environment should appear at the beginning of the commandline
It can be deactivated by running:
```shell
(venv) $ deactivate
```

### Installation of SmartPy library

After having activated your virtual environment, you can install SmartPy by running:
```shell
(venv) $ pip install smartpy
```

Verification of the installation:

```shell
(venv) python -c "import smartpy"
```

If the command returns nothing then the installation is successful.

### Installation of the command line interface

```shell
sh <(curl -s https://smartpy.io/cli/install.sh)
```

#### Compiling SmartPy Contracts or Expressions

_SmartPy.sh compile_

```shell
~/smartpy-cli/SmartPy.sh compile <script.py> <output-directory>
```

This includes many outputs including:
- generated michelson code for contract and storage
- generated json code for contract and storage

#### Executing a SmartPy Script with its tests

_SmartPy.sh test_

```shell
~/smartpy-cli/SmartPy.sh test <script.py> <output-directory>
```

This includes many outputs: types, generated michelson code, pretty-printed scenario, etc.
