## Entry points, storage and code

Michelson is a domain-specific language and is designed for implementing smart contracts. Tezos smart contracts contains three main information:
- the type definition of the **parameter** when invoking the smart contract (often called **entry point**)
- the type definition of the persistent data structure associated with the smart contract (referred as **storage**)
- a sequence of instructions to execute when invoking the smart contract (this is the **code** of the smart contract)

So basically, an empty smart contract defines those three information (parameter, storage, code) and looks like this:

```js
parameter unit;
storage unit;
code { CDR ;
       NIL operation ;
       PAIR };
```

The example below shows a simple smart contract implementing a counter: 

```js
{ parameter (or (or (nat %add) (nat %sub)) (unit %default)) ;
  storage int ;
  code { AMOUNT ; PUSH mutez 0 ; ASSERT_CMPEQ ; UNPAIR ;
         IF_LEFT
           { IF_LEFT { ADD } { SWAP ; SUB } }
           { DROP ; DROP ; PUSH int 0 } ;
         NIL operation ; PAIR } }
```

Notice that the type definition of the storage is `int`.

The three possible entry points (add, sub and default) are specified in a single logical structure composed of logical _or_ operators. Since _or_ is a two-operand operator, we need a nested _or_ structure to represent 3 or more elements.

```js
(or (or (nat %add) (nat %sub)) (unit %default))
```

We will go deeper in the code part in the "union" section.

## Address and balance

Tezos smart contracts also have some built-in internal information such as an address (where the smart contract is deployed) and a balance associated with this address (once deployed).

The balance represents the quantity of XTZ associated with a smart contract. The smallest divisible part is a mutez (1 tez = 1,000,000 mutez).


## Stack-based language

Generally a _stack_ data structure is a linear collection of elements where elements can be added or removed with `PUSH` and `POP` instructions. In the Michelson language, elements can be pushed on top of the pile or removed from the top of the pile. This kind of stack is called LIFO (Last In First Out).

*Illustration of a stack*

The _Instructions_ section describes basic stack manipulations allowed by the Michelson language.

## Invocation and transaction return (list of operation, storage)

The invocation of a smart contract is an explicit call for executing the code of the smart contract. It requires a call parameter which is a tuple of two elements (`PAIR`) containing:
- a value of the entry point
- the value of the storage (current storage state)

The invocation of the smart contract is expected to produce a tuple of two elements (`PAIR`) containing:
- a list of operations (which are new transactions generated by this invocation).
- the new storage state.

This list of operations represents all impacts your contract will have on the rest of the Tezos blockchain.
The new storage state represents the impact your invocation will have on the contract storage.

The diagram below describes the execution of the "empty smart contract" (seen in the previous section). Although this contract does not modify anything, it still has to fulfill the mentioned expectations (input and output format).

*Execution of `CDR ; NIL operation ; PAIR`*

Notice that this script does no modification. The storage is given as parameter and returned.


Now, let's deep dive into the Michelson language.
