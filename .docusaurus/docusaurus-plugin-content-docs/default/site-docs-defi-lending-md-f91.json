  "description": "It is likely that at some point in your life you have had to borrow some money, e.g. for a student loan, a car loan or a mortgage. Lending and borrowing are essential services in any financial system. Traditionally, lenders such as banks provide you with a loan in exchange for a fee, in the form of interest rates. Repaying said loan is enforced by legal contracts with the bank.",
