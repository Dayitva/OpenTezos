  "description": "You have likely in your life had to borrow some money, e.g., for a student loan, a car loan, or a mortgage. Lending and borrowing are essential services in any financial system. Traditionally, lenders such as banks provide you with a loan in exchange for a fee in the form of interest rates. Repaying the said loan is enforced by legal contracts with the bank.",
